## Welcome to my data science portfolio website.  

On this website I post articles and code/projects I am currently working on. Currently I am set to graduate before November 2020 as a biotechnician from the Hogeschool Utrecht. 
The highlights of my education so far include:  

* *In Vivo:* In my 3rd year I specialized in zoology and performed a multitude of laboratory animal procedures. Part of this specialization was a year-long internship at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience.  
* *In Vitro:* I have a great interest in molecular biology. Throughout the 4 years of study I gained practical experience in numerous molecular techniques such as the production of recombinant DNA vectors and transfection into cells. Other techniques include but are not limited to PCR, ELISA, western blot and cell culture.
* *In Silico:* For my minor I attended bio-informatics courses. [*Name:* **Thomas Baardemans**  
*Education:* **Life Sciences (Hogeschool Utrecht)**  
*Location:* **Utrecht, Netherlands**  
*Mail:* **thomas.baardemans at gmail.com**]{style="float:right; text-align: right"}   
These were mostly centered around the R language and ranged from  
basic data analysis to interpretation of RNA-seq results. I use Shiny to develop
applications and hope to use this together with python in the lab to develop  
data-acquisition tools/scripts.
